# MNIST dataset analysis

M2 CMB project for machine learning.

The data can be found at https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ or imported directly into R using the `dslabs` package.

## MNIST dataset

The data we'll be working with is made up of $28 \times 28$ images of handwritten digits, size normalized to fit in a $20 \times 20$ grid in the center of each image. 
The images are all in grayscale, with pixel values from 0 to 255. 

*WIP, will write more according to other details that come along while working on the project.*

## The goal

The overarching goal of this class's project is to extract accurate information from the data provided. In our case, I assume this would mean trying to get the best classifier for the dataset's digits, according to sufficiently relevant metrics.

Additional things the teacher mentionned *could* be interesting for our subject : 
- EM algorithm
- Bernoulli 
- wavelets ?

The report needs to be written in RMarkdown, so I created a folder `report` in which we'll place it, not to mix it up with the actual code files (which we might want to use for extensive testing). I'm planning on putting the others in `src`.
